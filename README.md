This is a modified version that removes some enchantments and features I don't like to have.

Apotheosis is a mod about adding additional layers of content to vanilla systems.  It doesn't add much in the way of blocks or items, but it adds a significant amount of content.
It's divided into modules, each separate from another.  Any module can be disabled at will, but all the modules work best when they are all enabled.

The following modules are present:
* Enchanting: Adds a ton of extra enchantments, uncaps the enchanting table, and edits some core mechanics of the game.
* * Anvil: Anvils can be enchanted, and are also uncapped.
* Spawner: Mob Spawners can be customized, and they can be changed to any type by acquiring spawn eggs.
* Deadly: Boss Monsters and Rogue Spawners are present in the world, both with the potential for unique loot.
* Potion: Recipes for unused vanilla potions, and additional potion effects.
* Village: Changes to the wandering trader, and a new use for the fletching table.
* Garden: Infinite height for Cactus, Sugarcane, and Bamboo, as well as a tool for moving animals.
